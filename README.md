### About The Project

Welcome to the official repository for the **SQC Club Website**. 

SQC is the premier technical body of the **Information Technology Department at Dr. B. R. Ambedkar National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar**. This website serves as the digital face of our community, showcasing our technical prowess, upcoming events, and the innovative spirit of our students.

The site is designed with a focus on **modern aesthetics**, **performance**, and **accessibility**, reflecting the cutting-edge nature of our domain.
It is based on a dark theme which boasts good user experience.

I used basic **html**, **css** along with **javascript** to generate this site.


### Key Features
* **Modern UI/UX:** A clean, aesthetic with a focus on typography and whitespace.
* **Dynamic Event Showcase:** Sections to highlight hackathons, workshops, and coding contests.
* **Additional:** Specialised section for the CHI-CHI robot.
